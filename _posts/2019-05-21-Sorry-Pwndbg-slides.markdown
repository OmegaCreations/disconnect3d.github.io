I am sorry to Robin Oleksy. I copied a few of their slides to my Pwndbg talk (I had at Security PWNing Conference 2018 and at Empire Hacking meetup) without asking for permission and without giving credit. This wasn't intentional but happened. Because of that I removed all their slides and replaced them with others.
